# TriviaNight
A trivia app for Android!

Bored at home with nothing to do? Test your random knowledge! How many can you get correct?

# Trivia Questions
Trivia Night pulls trivia questions from [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) and [The Trivia API](https://the-trivia-api.com/), both of which are free public APIs. In the future, I would like to curate questions host my own API.

# Getting Started
Getting started with Trivia Night is very easy!

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project with Android Studio.
3. Synchronize the project with Gradle Files.
4. Run the application.

# Technology
- Hilt for dependency injection.
- Retrofit for making HTTP requests to different APIs.
- Jetpack Compose for UI.
